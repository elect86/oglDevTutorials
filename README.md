Modern OpenGL Tutorials

JOGL porting of the http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk tutorials


PS: if time-based events looks too much slow or fast, then take a look on the v-sync and modify your parameter accordingly

PPS: project is temporary in stand-by because I am working on jAssimp, as soon as I will get the MD2 importing working as oglDev I'll go on, feel free to contribute! :)
